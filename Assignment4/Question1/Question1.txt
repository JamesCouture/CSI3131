a. Define a page-replacement algorithm using this basic idea. Specifically address
these problems:
i. What the initial value of the counters is
	Initial counter value  = 0
ii. When counters are increased
	Counter values increased when a new page is associated with that frame
iii. When counters are decreased
	Counter values decreased when a frame is no longer used
iv. How the page to be replaced is selected
	Select the page with the smallest counter. Select the page with the smallest counter in frame. You can use FIFO to break ties.

b. How many page faults occur for your algorithm for the following reference string,
for four page frames?
	There would be 13 faults for that algorithm.

c. What is the minimum number of page faults for an optimal page replacement
strategy for the reference string in part b with four page frames?
	There would be 11 faults using an optimal page replacement.
