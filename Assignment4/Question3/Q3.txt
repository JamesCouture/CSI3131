To run the code, the following commands are recommended:

//To compile
gcc consumer.c -pthread -lrt -o consumer
gcc producer.c -pthread -lrt -o producer

//To run (6 is the number that it will go to)
./producer 6 & ./consumer

**Note: It only works until 6, after that the libraries used do not support the sharing of variables with larger int values and the code stops working properly
